ignoring bike path at nadrazi vitkovice

As of 2025, Svinov to Ostrava hlavni (5.4km) is frequent eastbound, but only if one includes reservation-only Praha-Bohumin SuperCity trains for which it's apparently not possible to buy a ticket for that segment (though one could probably buy a ticket for a longer segment and get off early)
